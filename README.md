# Making Disagreements at Work Respectful and Productive

Workshop from January 2021 at [You Got This From Your Couch](https://yougotthis.io/couch/).

## Worksheets

These are going to be needed for the two breakout sessions of the workshop:

* [Breakout 1](breakout_one.md)
* [Breakout 2](breakout_two.md)
## Further Reading

There are so many resources that are useful. I've added several in the [further reading](further_reading.md) section, but anything around solving problems and communication will be worth reading if you want to explore more.

## Slides

The slides will be (or have been depending when you read this!) made available on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/krider2010/making-disagreements-at-work-respectful-and-productive)
