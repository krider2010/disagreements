For the following reviews, how could you convey the same (or more) information in a way less likely to cause confusion or offence? Assume that we have basic tooling in place such as linters to enforce an agreed upon formatting standard.

1. I cannot imagine why you would even think to implement it like ...

2. I donâ€™t like ... about this solution. _blocks merge_

3. I don't think this is an good solution. _sprinkles emojis such as âœ‚ or ðŸ”« around various lines of code_

Discuss different ways of responding for these three situations in your group, and have some alternatives ready to share with the wider group.
