# Breakout Two - Refining Communication

1. Demanding an author make changes based primarily on the mindset of "how would I write this code?" isn’t appropriate. This kind of feedback is optional and should be marked as such (often using "nit"). What examples of this have you been given? Or given to others?

2. Inflammatory feedback such as "this is crap" isn’t feedback. It's unkind and counter productive. What are some ways in which you can convey that something is not good enough that keeps the conversation open and helps the author to get to their goal of shipping the PR?

3. Asking for a change without providing context for what needs to be fixed (e.g. "this is inefficient") doesn't help the author to address your concerns. It's highly likely they are not mind readers! How can you provide clearer communication about a required code change?

Collect together responses from your group for these questions for sharing with the wider workshop.
